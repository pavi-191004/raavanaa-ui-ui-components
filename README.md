# Raavana

Raavanaa is a digital platform that helps students build smart profiles, makes it easy for colleges to manage recruitment activities, and gives recruiters a clear view of candidates’ real skills.

It’s not just about resumes. It’s about skills, growth, and connecting the right people together.

The platform is made up of three main parts:

-	For colleges (Admin)
-	For students (Candidates)
-	For companies (Recruiters)

## Why we are Building Raavana?

In today’s world, students are learning many things beyond what’s in their textbooks. But a traditional resume doesn’t always show that.

Colleges are trying to help their students grow, but there’s no simple way to manage everything in one place. Recruiters want to hire the right talent, but it’s hard to know what a student is truly capable of just by reading a resume.

Raavana brings everyone together and makes it easier to see, grow, and connect through real skills.

## What is the purpose of this repository?

The purpose of this repository is to provide a collection of reusable, consistent, and customizable UI components that can be easily integrated into different projects. By centralizing these components in one place, we aim to:

```bash
- Ensure design consistency across applications.

- Save development time by reusing pre-built, tested components.

- Promote scalability and maintainability in UI development.

- Encourage collaboration and contribution for continuous improvement.
```

This repository acts as a UI library where developers can quickly pick the components they need (such as buttons, modals, forms, navigation, etc.) and implement them without building everything from scratch.

## What contents does it have?

This repository contains a wide range of ready-to-use UI components designed to speed up development and maintain design consistency. The components are built with reusability and flexibility in mind, making them suitable for different projects.

Some of the components included are:

```bash
- Buttons – Primary, secondary, icon buttons, and more.

- Forms – Input fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, and validation-ready forms.

- Navigation – Sidebars, navbars, breadcrumbs, and tabs.

- Modals & Dialogs – Alert dialogs, confirmation modals, and popovers.

- Cards & Layouts – Responsive cards, grids, and containers.

- Utilities – Loaders, tooltips, badges, and notifications.
```

Each component is:

```bash

- Reusable – Can be easily integrated into multiple projects.

- Customizable – Supports theming and styling.

- Responsive – Works well across desktop and mobile devices.
```
